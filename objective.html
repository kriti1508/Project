<p> OUR OBJECTIVE </p>

<p>An intelligent use of the bodily organs in a child provides the best and the quickest way of developing the intellect of the child. The development of the mind and body must go hand in hand with a corresponding awakening of the soul. Hence a proper and all round development of the intellect can take place only when it proceeds with the education of the physical and spiritual features of a child, which constitute an individual whole. M.G.M. aims at developing each child into such a whole personality. Such whole personalities developed in M.G.M. will have no shade of darkness with them. Hence our motto - "THAMASO MA JYOTIRGAMAYA".</p>

<p>The most important period of a child's growth is upto six years of age. Though learning starts from the womb of the mother, the apt to start formal education is 3 years. The child needs a friendly environment and trained teachers during this period.</p>

<p>The salient features of the human development programme of M.G.M. aiming at the creation as a whole individual are seven, fold not seven holes, not seven parts but seven phases of one integrated whole. They are intimately related and indistinguishable.</p>
